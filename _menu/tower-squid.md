Come round to Calamari Tim's for our Leaning Tower of ~~Flaming~~ Squid, but make sure you're super duper extra hungry!
This tower of squid weighs in at 43lbs, and is 14ft tall (that's 4.25 meters for our friends in the backwards lands of socialism). Currently, the only tower of squid officially sanctioned by the WHO!
