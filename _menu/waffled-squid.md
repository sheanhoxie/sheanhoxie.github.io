Waffled Squid made it's way to C.T's about 13 years ago on a trip to Fresno, CA. After partaking in the local customs, I woke up, still fueled by my 3 day meth binge, with a hunger. It was only later during my trial watching security footage was I reminded of my love of waffle fries. That day, after serving 3 years with good behavior, Squid Waffles were born.
